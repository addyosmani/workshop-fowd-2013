For FOWD London, 2013.

*Where possible attendees should have Grunt, Yeoman and Bower installed however if not these will be shown at points during the day*

* 9.30:-10.30 - Part 1. Backbone.js - Practicals include snippets, Spacebook (Facebook clone).
* 11:00-12.30 - Part 2. Require, REST, Yeoman. Practicals include a RESTful Backbone app.
* 1.30-3:00 - Part 3. Marionette - Practicals include building a complete Marionette app.
* 3:00-5: - Part 4. Aura - Practicals include building Aura widgets with/without Yeoman.

These are the core concepts we'll be covering, however we may also do a whirlwind tour of DevTools, performance optimization and other Yeoman bits depending on time.
