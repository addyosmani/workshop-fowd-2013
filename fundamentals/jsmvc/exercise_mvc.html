      <h1>Exercise: MVC</h1>
      <br><br>

      <p>In this exercise, you will take an app and split it into a Model and View.</p>

      <p>Go through these steps, and do as many as you can in the time we have:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Download <a href="exercise_mvc_starter.html">this file</a> and save it into your project folder.
          Open it up in your browser and make sure it works. You should see a list of videos,
          and when you click on them, a modal pops up that plays the video.</li>
        <li>Read through the code and try to understand what it's doing.</li>

        <li><h3>Modeling The Data</h3></li>
        <li>Create a <code>VideoModel</code> object that represents a video.
          Your model object should take in a JSON object
          and store title, author, and youtubeID properties. It should also calculate
          an embed and preview URL. (Hint: Look at BookModel in the slides)
        </li>
        <li>Create a <code>VideoCollection</code> object that represents a collection of videos. 
          It should take in JSON and turn it into
          an internal <code>items</code> array of <code>VideoModel</code> instances.
          It should also have a <code>sort</code> method that sorts the <code>items</code> by title. 
          (Hint: Look at BookCollection in the slides - 90% of the code in the slides)
        </li>
        <li>Modify the code in <code>document.ready</code> to create a <code>VideoCollection</code>
          and sort it. 
        </li>
        <li>Change the for loop to iterate through the items in the <code>VideoCollection></code> and
        pass them to the <code>addVideoToList</code> function.
        </li>
        <li>Try loading the page now and see if your code works. Are there any errors? Look at the console
          and work through them one by one. You may have to modify a few things in your <code>addVideoToList</code>
          function.
        </li>

        <li><h3>Creating the View</h3></li>
        <li>Create a <code>VideoItem</code> view. It should be very similar to <code>addVideoToList</code>,
          but instead of appending to the global DIV (<code>#videos-list</code>), it should return a DIV.
        </li>
        <li>In the for loop in <code>document.ready</code>, change the code to create a new <code>VideoItem</code>
          object, and append the resulting DIV to the global <code>#videos-list</code> DIV there instead.
        </li>
        <li>Try loading the page and see if your code works!</li>
        <li>Bonus: Test the reusability of your code now by creating a new DIV in the HTML <code>#videos2-list</code>
          and see if you can create new item views to insert in that DIV.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Make sure that you use your browser developer tools to make debugging easier
while working on this. Check for errors, and use console.log() to figure out
how far your code makes it, and what the values of your variables are along the way.</p>
