Morning Practicals
====================

OMGGG. IT'S HAPPY AWESOME CODING TIME. In this first group of practicals you have the choice
of walking through the following tasks and tutorials:

* **RESTful** - a Backbone + RESTful API all taking you through CRUD [30-40mins]
* **Spacebook** - a Facebook clone built with Backbone [30-40mins]
* **Tooling** - a Kitlers (Cats + Hitler) app built with Yeoman/Bower/Grunt [10mins]

For those familiar with Backbone and RequireJS interested in reviewing how a large
application might be structured using them, I recommend reviewing:

* **Google Tasks** (review-google-tasks)

For those new to Backbone and/or RequireJS, I recommend starting with:

* **Backbone snippets** (review-snippets) which you can play with in the console.
* **RequireJS snippets** (review-require) which you can run in the browser
