What is GitView
--------------------
GitView is a Github issue viewer built with Backbone, originally created as part of a project by Jack Wang. The data is pulled from Github issue API (http://developer.github.com/v3/issues/).

If possible, run from a local server (e.g localhost).

Practical
---------------------

Whilst this Backbone application works, it suffers from a number of issues which prevent it from being more reusable in other projects. Review issues-viewer.js and issues-viewer-helper.js, noting:

* What hardcoded data could be moved into some configuration to make this more reusable?
* What changes would make it easier to switch out templates or improve how the output of this code looks?

Implement your suggested changes then either ask Addy to review what you've done, or push your code to GitHub and request a review after the workshop is over.
